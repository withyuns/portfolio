                                    <p>
                                        In the morning, Shuttle buses usually pass the bus stop where I am waiting. I really hate this situation. What other way is there to know how many people there are in line or when the last bus left from the previous bus stop? This app is the solution!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This is mobile-app for Android OS. This project is class project in CSE 110 (Software Engineering) at UCSD. We had customer team, so the team gave comments and opinions what they want to have. Our school system has quarter system (We have 10 weeks for a single quarter) so we had 10 weeks to finish the project. What is project about? Take a look!</p>

                                        <b>Step 1. Meet our customers, and get our assignment.</b><br/>
                                        Our customers gave a good idea of the mobile app that we had to make. That was the "Bus communication app". This is description of our app. "Don't want to wait in a long line for a bus? Then just install the app. You can see when the last bus left and report when the line is full." This is very simple, you just report whenever bus just left or report how full bus is. This is a scenario that our customer described. "Now, I am about to leave, and head to the bus stop. I need to ask someone who tell me how long the bus line is and how full the bus is right now. I have the app "BusBuzz", so that this app tells me how full it is, so that I don't need to wait in a long line!"
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin-bottom: 7px;">
                                        <b>Step 2. Coding. Now turning the plan to reality.</b><br/>
                                        We translated the customer's needs to the actual real world. We used Android Studio program. This program is special for Android mobile developer. It was my first time using this program, so I was very excited to use it! Java is familiar language for me, but it was a long time since I have used it. Android is based on Java language, so I needed time to understand the Android system and new software I needed to make. The rest of time, we wrote the code based on our customers' requests, and sometimes we tried to find bugs or errors that we didn't expect to see. We were CS people so we were all proud of it!
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin-bottom: 7px;">
                                        <b>Step 3. Feedback every week. Process of how real world is</b><br/>
                                        Other than class, we have group meetings every week. We delivered runnable software every week, so we can get any comments and feedbacks from our customers. Sometimes, we tried to reassure them that we were adjusting the app and update them on the process so far. After 10 weeks, we finally finished the app and showed the app to our classmates
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin-bottom: 7px;">
                                        <b>Wrap Up:</b><br/>
                                        The app was not launched to the Android market, but it was a super good experience that I never experienced before. Mobile apps, Software group project, and all the process during the project. Even updating user story on big board was such a surprise to me. It was interesting and I thought that is so useful to see how our project was currently going. This was just first small mobile-app but from the first experience, I am sure I will make more bigger and more creative mobile app in the future.
